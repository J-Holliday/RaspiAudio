## Overview

[master]

[musashikoganei]->[shinkoganei]

Shinkoganei should separate yukkuri from raspisan.py,
and create yukkuri class and organize aquestalk path.


## Status

I have separated yukkuri, and realized importing from other directory.

But I got points of improvement.
* I should refactoring musicPlayer.py and newsStation.py.
- I should use function without class.
- This problem is taken over to tama branch.
- After all, shinkoganei is not executable branch.

## Description

Mitaka has below policy.

1. Separate class from main module.
2. Define constant value to conf-file.
